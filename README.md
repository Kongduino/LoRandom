# LoRandom

A library using Semtech's sx1276/7/8/9's `RegRssiWideband` register properly to generate random numbers. See [this issue](https://github.com/sandeepmistry/arduino-LoRa/issues/394) for context.

This was written for Sandeep Mistry's library, but is easily adaptable to other platforms.

See [ESP32_Random_Test](https://github.com/Kongduino/ESP32_Random_Test) for an example of how it works.
